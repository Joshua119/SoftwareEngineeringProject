In this game students will be able to explore a virtual recreation of a colonial town and interact with its inhabitants. 
By interacting with the NPCs, students can also play three different mini-games that will test their typing skills and 
knowledge of social studies. Our three mini-games will be a typing racer, a vocabulary game and a quiz on geography. 
This game is recommended for students in grades 4 through 6. The education level is based on the Massachusetts History 
and Social Science Curriculum.
